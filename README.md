This repository is the Unity environment used in my user study on perception and object plausibility in Augmented Reality. It is a 3D testing environment with customizable levels of interaction, shadows, and physics. It saves transition state maps created by the study participant to a csv for further analysis. The development and study was done using a Hololens2 and MRTK in Unity.
